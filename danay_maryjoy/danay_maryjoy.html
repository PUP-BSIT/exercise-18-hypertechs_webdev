					<ul>
						<li>
							<h3>Gardening </h3>
							<p>Bring a touch of <strong>Southwestern</strong> 
								charm to any home <em>d√©cor</em> with an easy
								care cactus dish garden. A collection of 
								assorted cacti and succulents come together 
								in a charming Pueblo-design pot, creating a 
								unique desert garden-scape alive with 
								eye-catching texture and color. Assortment 
								of cacti and succulent plants.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3>Swimming</h3>
							<p>Swimming is a very fun activity that many can 
								participate in. You can start a hobby of
								swimming by finding a swimming pool and 
								stepping in. Personally, swimming is an 
								amazing recreational hobby. It gets you 
								active without sweating profusely.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3>Hiking</h3>
							<p>As a hobby, hiking is a wonderful way to connect 
								with nature, challenge yourself, and experience
								the world around you in a unique and meaningful 
								way. Whether you're a seasoned hiker or a 
								beginner looking to start, there's a trail out 
								there waiting for you.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3>Drawing</h3>
							<p>Sketching and drawing is a great way to improve 
								your creative skills and start thinking in a 
								different way. Art shows you that there is 
								normally more than one way to solve a problem. 
								Art encourages open ended thinking and 
								creativity. These can be really helpful for 
								personal development and solving problems.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3>Walking</h3>
							<p>Walking as a hobby helps with a person's overall 
								health and mental wellness. Walking is a
								low-impact exercise that allows a person to 
								clear his or her mind while benefitting from
								a good form of exercise. It is common knowledge 
								that having a hobby helps in a person's health 
								and satisfaction.
