# HYPERTECHS™

🧑‍💻 Coding the future, one line at a time.

## Description

🤖 Welcome...back to HyperTechs! We are a vibrant collective of students at PUP Taguig with a shared passion of honing our skills in web development. We dive deep into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on a mission to master the art and science of crafting captivating and functional websites.

## Exercise 18 🆕

For this week's exercise, we've added a unique new section in each of our profile website based on our interests, where visitors can:

✨ **Create**: Craft personalized lists for your unique needs

📖 **Read**: Dive into the lists for quick insights and organization

🚀 **Update**: Easily modify and refine lists anytime you want; and

🗑️ **Delete**: Streamline and declutter by removing items or entire lists.

To achieve this, we've created our own **_custom-made_ REST API** on the backend that works seemlessly behind the scenes at our newest web domain. Be sure to check it out!
